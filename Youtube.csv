1,18 minutes to wipe his arse.
2,Putin is a homie hopper.
3,"The inner workings of the trump thing's head is a total mess.
It has found pure confusion and has gone absolutely nuts. 
trump is screaming and shouting at people, brainwashing them into believing what he wants. 
He and his cult are a disgrace to our nation and don't care how many lives they ruin. 
These are angry people, especially trump, who works full time for putin. 
They wont even recognize their bad acts and crimes.
THIS  IS  TOTALLY  NOT  A  WITCH  HUNT!"
4,"Omg ladies and gentlemen, I present the president of the US🙄🤢🤮"
5,"Sugar Vladi!!! hahahahahahaha I can't with Jimmy's pun, Trump's KGBFF!!"

7,The love of God will never fail those God  placed his trust in.

B] I love that you disable comments for videos with kids in them - smart and protective! More like Kimmel, please!"
9,I came here for Jimmy😂💖
10,That's why Donnie's so upset! Pencey's moving in on his man.
11,It's time to put old yeller down
12,Omg hahahah sugarvladdy hahahah
13,Remember the Benghazi and whitewater investigations? Compare those to the Mueller stuff...
14,"""sugar vladdy"" 😂😂😂😂"
15,Orange is the new black
16,Orange hair is funny.

18,"Tasmanian devil ? More like a screaming pumpkin demon if you ask me, countdown to impeachment starts NOw"
19,Sugar Valaddy😂😂😂
20,We are hearing this for the last two years!!!  Tell us something new!!
21,"That level of eloquence is very unusual for Trump. Did he copy that from a  political analyst criticizing his administration? I can imagine that the original read something like: ""The inner workings of the Trump administration are a total mess, etc."""
22,18 minute break... he should eat more fiber. 🚽
23,"I don’t care about trump, but it’s funny to see jimmy used to love the man until he ran for president."
24,Spinning? That dude's downright spun.
25,"""Inner Workings a Total Mess"" , ""Screaming and Shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want"" ... Is Trump just projecting what is happening around him onto Mueller??"
26,Good Morning
27,"Hey Americans, what does it feel like being in the Prequel to the movie 'Idiocracy'?"
28,Love u Trump from India.. haters r jealous of u 😂😂😁😁no hard feelings
29,"Treasonous bastards, the whole administration."
30,"Why is it so hard to investigate crimes committed by Trump supporters?

Because there are no dental records and they all share the same DNA!"
31,"If dotard trumpus knew the inner workings of the Mueller investigation, he would have fled to Russia and taken dotard jr. with him!! Leave dotard! Flee to your daddy putin!!"
32,"Even if I disregard witches... McCarthysm, duh"
33,"Head line ""trump moves to Russia "" to live his life out with his mentor."
34,"Normally people that are guilty, always screams that they are innocent, when they're guilty as hell. The only thing that's a disgrace to America, is Donald Trump"
35,"Meanwhile
 
'We are losing': Trump and his top advisors aren't publicly admitting how bad things are in Afghanistan.

America is conducting counterterror operations in 76 countries and US troops are fighting and dying everywhere from Afghanistan to Niger."
36,Killed witches? More like innocent women because they couldn't take the fact that a women is smarter than them.
37,"A innocent person wouldnt be this crazy to try to protect themselves....if ur not guilty, ur doing probably the worst job in history of trying to act no guilty"
38,Who's prepared for black friday?
39,Behind the scenes Melania running the country.
40,"Wait, he was in control before? he went bankrupt six times, for Christ's sake!"
41,Hey Jimmy stop showing love for Donald Trump publicly
42,"Trump needs to leave McCains name out of his delusional statements, McCain has passed and Trump needs to have some decency ."
43,Do we get a Orange Saturday after Black Friday?
44,What happened to the invisible hamster?
45,You spin my head right round
46,to felony
47,Sugar Vladdy 😂😂😂😂😂
48,Trump supporter's IQ can not measure by numbers. It can only be measured by how many teeth they still have!
49,I love u jimmy but u srsly give trump too much attention find something else!! ❤️❤️
50,Like if jimmy Kimmel is hype beast cuk lord trump stalker!!! pathatic man he is..makes trump look tolrable..only helping him..

52,Burn him as a evil witch lmao 🤣 🤘
53,How's November guys?
54,How you know there is new episode of Jimmy Kimmel? There is a new Trump joke in the air. Every. Episode. Jimmy Kimmel should be glad Trump got to president. He has gotten so much content out of him.
55,orange man bad.
56,First
57,"this will go viral... 34,281 views"
58,Hello! <3 from Tasmania. (Really.)
59,I don’t think trump knows there was real witch hunting in America that’s far too intellectual for him to understand
60,"If Obama didn't go to Arlington on Veteran's Day, fake Fox News would still be talking about it."
61,This man is the biggest disgrace ever to happen to the US. He is the laughing stock of the World.
62,Remember those shirts about feelings well the country just told you potus back at ya.
63,I’m very very content with the Midterm Elections. I VoTED BLuE 🌊🌊🇺🇸🌊🌊
64,"Who other than a completely out of the loop and clueless individual could possibly be confused that failing to attend a veteran's memorial when you hold the title of Commander in Chief could be anything other than a public relations nightmare.  Either Trump is as clueless as he always appears to be or he is just used to trying to pass along any of his own failures to his staff. There is no third option, and that is SAD."
65,Maybe Donnie Johnny has no true friends because he is not a true friend.  Everyone knows that he will throw anyone under the bus at a moment's notice in order to protect himself.
66,"Trump, a 73 year old man who CLAIMS to be a super-patriot AND a genius, didn't KNOW that failing to go to the 100th anniversary of commemorating fallen WW1 soldiers on Nov. 11 was going to be a public relations nightmare? He actually needed someone to tell him that it was a very bad idea to skip that ceremony after he flew all the way to France to attend it? If Trump is so stupid that he can't figure a thing like that out by himself, WTF is he doing in the oval office?"
67,How dare he berate the British Prime minister...he is a fool and a joke around the world!
68,It does my heart good to know he's not enjoying the Presidency.
69,"He's becoming psychotic. More unstable.  Please, Lord, help heal this country."
70,Trump has no proper friends you can tell just by looking at the oaf
71,The grifter POTUS knows his dictatorship is over
72,There is absolutely no way Trump will be re-elected in 2020 get used to it Retardican voters.
73,"This could well be an advanced stage of psychopathic collapse, and with the realization that his enemies are winning and likely to achieve victory, absolutely anything is possible. For an American president, his worldview is narrow beyond the comprehension  of intelligent, sane people. He rarely goes outdoors except to golf on his own courses (and he's a flagrant cheater by all accounts), he has no pets, no friends he actually hangs out with. He's 72 and all the people he grew up around are gone. Look for a full King Lear-style denouement to this saga. His kids are worthless and likely to do to him what he did his daddy, take advantage of him in his old age and snap everything up before the Old Man loses it all. Being a pure paranoid, he'll even anticipate that. He's moored to nothing and everything's on the table from his perspective. Everything."
74,"The failing Trump Crime Family,"
75,"Reap what you sow, miserable clown."
76,"Trump's mood is going to get more sour when the Dems take over the House! Poor baby! FYI to our people in the military and our vets, remember how your president disrespected your service to the country this Veterans Day! DISGRACE!"
77,"Makes me think Trump shoved Melania forward to fire the National Security Aide. Melania may have had a personal issue with the woman, but it seems fishy that Melania didn't go to Trump, her own husband (and President) and have him make the announcement. These people are weak, bizarre and totally inexperienced. Let the impeachments and indictments begin. America deserves better."
78,"WOW, for a whole week? That's the same mood I had when Trump won in 2016, I was in a sour mood for like, probably until Inauguration Day. I didn't scream at people or something, I never wanted to talk to folks very often, but I was in a sour mood when Trump won, it took me two months to get over it, I'm no Trump fan obviously, but I kinda feel his pain there, I've been there, post-election day in 2016 was one of the worst times of my life. By the way, I voted for the Democrats to take the House of Representatives away from Trump, and I'm proud of my vote."
79,Very sour kid indeed.  How much can you expect from him ?
80,"Ah poor baby! Never mind it can only get better - orange jumpsuit, nice dry cell!!!!"
81,He lost the popular vote he has no business being President in the first place.
82,He can always defect back to Russia!
83,And the very public meltdown of Spanky Tweetie Twump begins...
84,Do you remember when Obama turned the WH into a pathetic soap opera?. I don't.
85,"Trump can't even live up to the standards of past REPUBLICAN presidents! My, how the mighty have fallen!!"
86,Orange Toxic goo Supporters don't care about Veterans !
87,"trump’s not retreating from his duties. How can you retreat when you’re already an REMF? (Rear Echelon Mo-Fo. You know, the guy with the BEST war stories. While he rides a desk, or a mop.)"
88,All I hear is Wahhhh!🤣😂
89,"Trump doesn't want military ballots counted in Florida and Georgia.  If I dodged the draft 5 times, vilified the father of a soldier who died fighting for this country, turned by back on homeless vets, cut veterans benefits, avoided visiting troops in war zones to play golf, not visit Arlington to pay respects to soldiers who died for this country and sent the military to an imaginary war, I wouldn't want to count military absentee ballots either."
90,Now he knows how most of us felt post the 2016 elections
91,All he does is watch fox and friends along with golf. What a Clown.
92,He doesn't listen to his counsel so why get mad that they don't approach him. Trump was claiming voter fraud before the presidential election voting had even started. He's a train wreck in process.
93,The weak man is worried now just wait for what is coming like I always say he ain't fit to be in the white house Obama was the best 🇺🇸👍
94,"You vote for a reality TV star for President, what did you expect?"
95,"FAKE PATRIOT! SAD!
Of course, this is not news to anyone who has half a brain."
96,"Well actually, technically Trump does have one friend he talks to every night: Hannity."
97,"Oh, waaah. What a cry baby. Let Melania, the immigrant who didn't have the credentials to work in America when she came here but did anyway, run the WH. Make her parents cabinet members, too. Some more nepotism won't matter. It won't be too much longer when he runs away and says ""I really, really didn't want to be the president anyway""."
98,He is a big baby & has always been in sour mood.  The only time he's happy is when he is in chaos--which is all the time.  No he didn't go to the vet's because he doesn't care about anyone but himself.  Remember Mr. Grinch will your looking at him.  This man will never be happy unless he has a war-CHAOS--CHAOS--CHAOS.  He just doesn't care about anyone & is not fit for office.  I'm sorry but that's the truth...Phoenix
99,He's only cranky because nobody changed his diaper.
