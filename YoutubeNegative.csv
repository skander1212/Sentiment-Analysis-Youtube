"I didn't scream at people or something, I never wanted to talk to folks very often, but I was in a sour mood when Trump won, it took me two months to get over it, I'm no Trump fan obviously, but I kinda feel his pain there, I've been there, post-election day in 2016 was one of the worst times of my life."
