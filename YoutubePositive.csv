It has found pure confusion and has gone absolutely nuts.
"trump is screaming and shouting at people, brainwashing them into believing what he wants."
He and his cult are a disgrace to our nation and don't care how many lives they ruin.
"7,The love of God will never fail those God  placed his trust in."
"8,""A] ‚ÄúMove on you like a witch‚Äù - promote this writer immediately, I nearly spat out my tea, Kimmel."
B] I love that you disable comments for videos with kids in them - smart and protective!
"More like Kimmel, please!"""
"16,Orange hair is funny."
"17,""History will not look kindly on Trump and his enablers, Mueller will be seen as a true patriot."""
"More like a screaming pumpkin demon if you ask me, countdown to impeachment starts NOw"""
Tell us something new!
"21,""That level of eloquence is very unusual for Trump."
"I can imagine that the original read something like: """"The inner workings of the Trump administration are a total mess, etc."""""""
"22,18 minute break... he should eat more fiber."
"23,""I don‚Äôt care about trump, but it‚Äôs funny to see jimmy used to love the man until he ran for president."""
"29,""Treasonous bastards, the whole administration."""
"33,""Head line """"trump moves to Russia """" to live his life out with his mentor."""
More like innocent women because they couldn't take the fact that a women is smarter than them.
"41,Hey Jimmy stop showing love for Donald Trump publicly"
"45,You spin my head right round"
It can only be measured by how many teeth they still have!
"49,I love u jimmy but u srsly give trump too much attention find something else!!"
"54,How you know there is new episode of Jimmy Kimmel?"
There is a new Trump joke in the air.
Jimmy Kimmel should be glad Trump got to president.
He has gotten so much content out of him.
<3 from Tasmania.
(Really.)
"59,I don‚Äôt think trump knows there was real witch hunting in America that‚Äôs far too intellectual for him to understand"
"63,I‚Äôm very very content with the Midterm Elections."
Either Trump is as clueless as he always appears to be or he is just used to trying to pass along any of his own failures to his staff.
"66,""Trump, a 73 year old man who CLAIMS to be a super-patriot AND a genius, didn't KNOW that failing to go to the 100th anniversary of commemorating fallen WW1 soldiers on Nov. 11 was going to be a public relations nightmare?"
"68,It does my heart good to know he's not enjoying the Presidency."
More unstable.
"73,""This could well be an advanced stage of psychopathic collapse, and with the realization that his enemies are winning and likely to achieve victory, absolutely anything is possible."
"For an American president, his worldview is narrow beyond the comprehension  of intelligent, sane people."
"He rarely goes outdoors except to golf on his own courses (and he's a flagrant cheater by all accounts), he has no pets, no friends he actually hangs out with."
Look for a full King Lear-style denouement to this saga.
"Being a pure paranoid, he'll even anticipate that."
"76,""Trump's mood is going to get more sour when the Dems take over the House!"
"Melania may have had a personal issue with the woman, but it seems fishy that Melania didn't go to Trump, her own husband (and President) and have him make the announcement."
"America deserves better."""
"78,""WOW, for a whole week?"
"By the way, I voted for the Democrats to take the House of Representatives away from Trump, and I'm proud of my vote."""
How much can you expect from him ?
"Never mind it can only get better - orange jumpsuit, nice dry cell!!!!"""
"81,He lost the popular vote he has no business being President in the first place."
"My, how the mighty have fallen!!"""
"You know, the guy with the BEST war stories."
"90,Now he knows how most of us felt post the 2016 elections"
"93,The weak man is worried now just wait for what is coming like I always say he ain't fit to be in the white house Obama was the best üá∫üá∏üëç"
Some more nepotism won't matter.
"It won't be too much longer when he runs away and says """"I really, really didn't want to be the president anyway""""."""
The only time he's happy is when he is in chaos--which is all the time.
This man will never be happy unless he has a war-CHAOS--CHAOS--CHAOS.
